# SPARQL Extensions
RPT's SPARQL extensions are provided by our unofficial Jena eXtensions project called [JenaX](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/).

* The section [RDF/SPARQL Processing - Examples](../examples) demonstrates both the usage of the `integrate` command as well as various SPARQL extenions.
* The extensions can be used standalone, such as with Jena Java projects, or as plugins for a Fuseki server. For more information, see the [JenaX ARQ Plugins documentation](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/jenax-arq-parent/jenax-arq-plugins-parent/README.html).
