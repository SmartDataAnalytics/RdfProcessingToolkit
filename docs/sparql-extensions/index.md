## SPARQL Extensions
RPT's SPARQL extensions are provided by our unofficial [JenaX Jena eXtenions project](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/).

* The section [RDF/SPARQL Processing - Examples](examples/README.html) demonstrates both the usage of the `integrate` command as well as various SPARQL extenions.
* A function reference is available at [http://jsa.aksw.org/fn/](http://jsa.aksw.org/fn/).
  Note, that the functions are being consolidated into the new `norse` (Not Only Rdf Sparql Extensions) namespace `norse: <https://w3id.org/aksw/norse#>`.
* Additional extensions are detailed at our [JenaX ARQ Plugins documentation](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/jenax-arq-parent/jenax-arq-plugins-parent/README.html).
