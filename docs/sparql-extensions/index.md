# SPARQL Extensions
RPT's SPARQL extensions are provided by our unofficial Jena eXtensions project called [JenaX](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/).

* The section [RDF/SPARQL Processing - Examples](examples/README.html) demonstrates both the usage of the `integrate` command as well as various SPARQL extenions.
* Additional extensions are detailed at our [JenaX ARQ Plugins documentation](https://scaseco.github.io/jenax/jenax-arq-parent/jenax-arq-plugins-parent/README.html).
